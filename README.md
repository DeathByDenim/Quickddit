Quickddit
=========

Quickddit is a free and open source Reddit client for mobile phones. Quickddit is **not** an official client
of Reddit and is not affiliated with Reddit in any way.

Quickddit is developed using Qt and currently available for MeeGo Harmattan (Qt 4.7.4), Sailfish OS (Qt 5.6) and Ubuntu-touch (Qt 5.9).
The logic part is developed in C++ while the UI is developed in QML.

The Harmattan port has been left at 1.0.0 feature level, and will not receive new features.

Reddit API client id and secret
----------------------------------

If you want to build Quickddit with OAuth support, remember to [get your own Reddit API client
id and secret](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/OAuth2) and fill it up in
[src/quickdditmanager.cpp](src/quickdditmanager.cpp) or define `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`,
`REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` and `REDDIT_REDIRECT_URL` in project file or QtCreator.

Optionally you can also define `IMGUR_CLIENT_ID` with your own Imgur API client id.
